    <li>Predictive and condition-based maintenance (PdM / CbM) are both maintenance types that occur before breakdowns happen. As such, they are both forms of proactive maintenance and are designed to increase reliability and decrease downtime.</li>
    <li>Predictive maintenance relies on precise formulas in addition to sensor measurements (temperature, vibration etc.), and maintenance work is performed based on the analysis of these parameters. In this way, predictive maintenance is a very exact form of maintenance because it predicts future maintenance events.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, condition-based maintenance relies only on real-time sensor measurements. Once a parameter reaches an unacceptable level, maintenance workers are dispatched. This means that condition-based maintenance systems perform work only in the moment it is needed.</li>
    <li>The below diagram is based on the above High level IIoT Applied architecture, but this is specific to the reliability engineering use case where condition monitoring and predictive maintenance is achieved through vibration analysis.</li>
