    Energy monitoring is a 3-phase development work. Phase-I, which is a Descriptive & Diagnostics analytics phase, is complete, with HCL as partner. The HVAC Air handling units in multiple sites LCC and LTC were chosen for the management view of energy consumption.
</p>

<p class="unlistHead">
    Phase 1 was to visualize energy consumption trends collectively for all AHUs or a single AHU for a particular building or all buildings on one site or all sites with-in a date range. This monitoring will help to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Spot the AHU/building/site where more energy is consumed for any particular day or days, which can be further investigated manually.
    </li>
    <li>To investigate, the parameters that affects the AHU having relatively more energy consumption.</li>
    <li>Active faults visual insight for AHU with-in a date range to identify the AHU with maximum fault count for further investigation.</li>
    <li>Comparing Active faults between two or more AHUs will help to investigate why one AHU has more faults than others do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Instrumentation for this phase-I was not done in terms of energy monitoring but only for manufacturing. No specific new devices/sensors were used for monitoring AHU's energy management data, but it was all process parameters used from OSI PI database.
</p>

<p class="unlistHead">
    Therefore, in short, local PI storage was required for the reason of-
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Local analytics requirements.
    </li>
    <li>Need to run operations in manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Comments/ Observations -</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Naming convention of tag values in PI system, at all sites differ.
    </li>
    <li> In future, there could be a possibility, that apart from all time-series data like process parameters and energy parameters, a high-speed vibration data aggregation is also required.</li>
    <li>Further, Phase 2 is supposed to be a Predictive analytics phase where proposed plan is to get weather data also for optimizing on energy needs and correct load assessments.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center">Phase 3 is proposed to be a Prescriptive analytics program</p>
