    <li>System should adhere to Lilly non-functional requirements (i.e. availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability etc.).</li>
    <li>System should have clearly defined platform services and their key responsibilities to achieve reliability engineering.</li>
    <li>The applied architecture should address all the security related concerns at all the layers - device and gateway layer, communication layer and storage layer</li>
    <li>Architecture should be flexible. The defined architecture is Micro services based that supports rapid extension and flexibility in the architecture to introduce new features via micro services-based design</li>
    <li>The defined architecture should be consumable by the stakeholders such that it can be used as a cookbook to implement the condition and predictive maintenance use case and should provide key guidelines for a choice of technology components, wherever necessary.</li>
    <li>High-level fitment of other Lilly use cases such as energy monitoring, QBMS, Lab use cases.</li>
    <li>The defined architecture should be flexible and adaptable so that it is future ready and can address the evolving technology changes in future.</li>
