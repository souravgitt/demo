<p>
    Based on features and capabilities the edge Gateways can be classified into four different logical groups as mentioned below.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Basic edge Gateway - Provides basic connectivity to IoT Cloud Platform.</li>
    <li>Advanced edge Gateway - Edge Computing & Connectivity to IoT Cloud Platform</li>
    <li>Specialized edge Gateway - Edge Device Management & Connectivity to IoT Cloud Platform.</li>
    <li>COTS edge Gateway - Connectivity & Data Aggregation for existing COTS vendor infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basic - Edge Gateway</h4>

<p>
    A Basic edge Gateway provides typical Gateway functions like connectivity to the IoT Cloud Platform, protocol translation and hosting of application and connectivity code for device communication. The gateway also provides support for security and update capabilities for Firmware, OS, Software which is generally manual.
</p>

<h4>Advanced - Edge Gateway</h4>

<p>
    Apart from basic functions like connectivity to the IIoT Cloud Platform, protocol translation, and hosting of application and connectivity code, the advanced Gateway provides additional compute, storage and memory resources for edge analytics for specific use cases. These devices also provide Firmware, OS, Software update capabilities and strong hardware-based security support for encryption.
</p>

<h4>Specialized - Edge Gateway</h4>

<p>
    In additional to supporting all the capabilities that Advanced Gateways, Specialized Gateways enable device management & monitoring of additional dependent devices at the edge in a closed loop scenario. These devices manage provisioning, monitoring and remote access and diagnostics for dependent devices.
</p>

<h4>COTS - Edge Gateway</h4>

<p>
    The CoTS (Custom off the Shelf) gateways are commercially available purpose-built Gateways that generally provide connectivity to existing CoTS vendor infrastructure. These gateways often act like a data aggregation and connectivity hub for their dependent devices.
