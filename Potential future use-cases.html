<p>Potential future use-cases to assess the extensibility of the proposed architecture:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Track n trace - Systems capable of recognizing and reporting the location and status of tools in a facility. The goal being to manage handheld power tools in manufacturing and maintenance environments more efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>Enterprise OEE - Getting a visibility into hindsight, insight and foresight of Manufacturing operations, visibility for downtime analysis, automatic alarm escalation and notifications, linking operational losses to financial outcomes and comparing key metrics across plants.</li>
    <li>Remote Service Platform - Remote services platform will help Lilly to remotely monitor upgrade and manage devices on the field. The following are the features of the platform.
        <ul>
            <li>Asset monitoring:</li>
            <li>Condition monitoring/ device health</li>
            <li>Remote S/W updates (firmware mgmt./patch mgmt.):</li>
            <li>Remote calibration</li>
            <li>Customizable dashboards</li>
            <li>Device on-boarding/lifecycle management</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Asset Health Management - Analyzing the health of an asset as determined by operational requirements of Monitoring, Diagnostic Analysis and Prognostic Analysis. This relates to the asset's utility, its need to be replaced, and its need for maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Computer Vision - Automate tasks that the human visual system can do in areas of detection, segmentation, localization, and recognition of certain objects in images e.g. human faces. Can also be used to improve process Quality through in-line quality testing
    </li>
    <li>Location based people tracking - Monitoring and controlling people movement to restricted areas in the lab.</li>
    <li>Augmented reality - Assist personnel with pick-and-place tasks in the warehouse and in maintenance and troubleshooting of assets by contracted workforce.</li>
    <li>Smart Labs: IoT'ization of lab instruments/equipment (legacy assets) will enable data collation at two levels: Automated collation of operational data - replacing current manual data recording and data validation process and conditional monitoring data for monitoring equipment health. Implementation of this use case is expected to bring following benefits:
        <ul>
            <li>Decrease servicing costs</li>
            <li>Maximize device uptime</li>
            <li>Predictive Analytics/Predictive Maintenance</li>
            <li>Better surveillance of heterogeneous lab assets.</li>
            <li>Differentiated user experience</li>
            <li>Streamlined operations</li>
            <li>Real-time asset mgmt</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
