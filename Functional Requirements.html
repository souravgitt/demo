<p>
    The Lilly applied Architecture is based upon the following key requirements (i.e. architectural goals).
</p>

<h4>1.1.1. Functional Requirements</h4>

<p>
    The applied architecture should address all the following key functional and non-functional requirements
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Integrate different types / categories of devices and gateways that can exist considering Lilly requirements.</li>
    <li>System should be capable to handle high-speed data (sampling rate <=100 ms) and low speed data (sampling rate >100 ms).</li>
    <li>System should be capable to do edge analytics if require in future.</li>
    <li>Data movement considerations as per criticality (red/amber/green) and GMP/Non GMP</li>
    <li>System is capable to ingest data from the different external and internal data applications e.g. external cloud to internal data center</li>
    <li>System is capable to ingest data in between internal data applications e.g. L3 PI to L4 enterprise PI</li>
    <li>Data security requirements will be met as per Lilly security consideration</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center">System should be capable to do device management for IIoT devices</p>
