<p>Lilly has 2-types of labs -</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Supporting R&D</strong> - It consist of lab procedures like large and small molecule analysis, purity identification, HPLC and gas chromatography. Reports from these experiments are mostly paper based and are manually transacted.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support Manufacturing</strong> - Used for in-process sampling from Manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional data capture strategy is planned in PRD environment.</p>

<p>
    The data acquisition from lab instruments can be categorized into - Analytical and Equipment information. It came out that most of the analytical data type is being used in routine, but No equipment information could be used because the equipment information integration is not available. It is desired that the IoT'ization of the labs help meet the following objectives -
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Operations - Use of new types of IIoT sensors, video camera and instruments linking the eco-systems to achieve integration of processes</li>
    <li>Business model transformation - Improve processes, walkup instruments and facilitate remote operations. The goal being, to be able to operate & control Manufacturing labs by anyone from anywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Comments/ Observations -</h4>

<p>
    It's observed that there are many possibilities around reducing paper-based work. In addition, manual entry of analytical data and manual instrument configuration could be avoided if all lab instruments are integrated around a business/data flow definition. For example, the Maximo system's data could be integrated with other systems/PI using REST APIs and time-based alerts for maintenance could be replaced to new, condition-based maintenance alerts, to raise the maintenance orders.
