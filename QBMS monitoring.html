<h4>Existing PoCs-</h4>

    <li>
        Vaisala's VaiNet LoRA based data loggers were used as a PoC for measuring and sending temperature and humidity data of a manufacturing environment. With only one gateway Lilly was able to achieve a lot of data collection but not able to marry/associate this monitoring system with other manufacturing environment measurement system.

        Measurement of change of performance on refrigeration cycle: Lilly need to manage defrost two times a year as part of maintenance for many refrigeration units. It is a substantial work force investment for such a maintenance because three people on shop floor just maintains refrigerators. Lilly want to put more thermocouples besides the sensors refrigerators already have. The process of installing new sensors to these units is cumbersome and costly, as it requires drilling holes into refrigerators for passing sensor wires out of the refrigerator box.
