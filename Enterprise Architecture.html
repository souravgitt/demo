<h4>HCL Understanding :</h4>

<p>
    The Lilly Enterprise architecture has an IoT reference architecture that is referred by GIS (Global Info. Sevices), to communicate across the enterprise the current and woud be IT landscape. It identifies 3 tiers(Edge, Platform, Consume & Act) and 5 layers (Device, Communication, Information, Service, Process) to show the "Logical View" of IoT at Lilly. A "Technical View" of this architecture, details out the services and capabilities within each tier and layer, that have either been rolled-out or Lilly believes would need to be stood-up, in order to support IoT use cases.
</p>
 
<p>
This perspective proves helpful in sharing a holistic view of IoT opportunities across the enterprise, identifying positioning of different functionalities and making sure that Lilly is appropriately is invested. The Lilly Ops model builds on this IoT Reference Architecture.

<p>
    Since, the findings (elaborated in further sections) point to adequateness of existing platforms to address Manufacturing needs, HCL thinks, Lilly should reduce, re-use and reclaim the existing services and components to avoid further heteroginity and diversity at the Platform level. This in turn will ensure adaptability and agility to the varying demands.
